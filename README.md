Numerical solver for Laplace equation based on the "The Distillation of Human Knowledge" cartoon from the book "A FORTRAN Coloring Book", by Roger E. Kaufman, MIT Press, 1978.

The main program works in two modes controlled by the `VISUAL` flag defined at the top of the file. If `VISUAL = true` the program will show a runtime animation of the simulation with dissipating heat (see demo below). If `VISUAL = false` the program will generate `.csv` files that can be opened in an external visualization software e.g. Paraview.
